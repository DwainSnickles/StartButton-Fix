I made a windows forms app to do this for you if you want to automate the process.

I found that by modifying the registry I could get the start button repaired so I made an automated app to repair it.

here is the link and how to use the app.

1) Download the link 

https://github.com/DwainSnickles/StartButton-Fix/blob/master/StartButton%20Fix.zip

2) Unzip it and run the exe file,

![StartButton](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7ac67e9-8d98-4392-836b-1d472585c391)


3) Select the current location of the start menu button

4) I forgot to add the close after repair check box so just ignore it.

5) Click the button to start the repair.

It simply changes the registry key from 0 or 1 respectively. It works for me every time. I assume no responsibility so use it at your own risk.

Or you can try it by yourself if you're comfortable with modifying the registry. 

How to get the windows start button right click working without creating a new user RESOLVED. This is what worked for me STEP BY STEP.

1) Open Settings

2) On left menu click Personalization

3) Scroll down to Taskbar Click it

4) Click Taskbar Behaviors

5) Click Taskbar Alignment

6) Check Select Center from dropdown list.

7) Note verify the windows icon will now be on the left side of the taskbar and if right click works, if you're ok with that your you're done.

To return the windows button back to center reselect center from dropdown menu and now you're back to normal.

Good luck enjoy the windows start button working again.
